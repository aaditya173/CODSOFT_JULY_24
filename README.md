# CODSOFT Internship Project: C++ Programs

This repository contains three C++ programs developed as part of an internship project. Each program serves a different purpose and demonstrates various aspects of C++ programming.

## Programs Included

1. **NumberGuessingGame.cpp**
   - This program implements a simple number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

2. **SimpleCalculator.cpp**
   - This program performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

3. **To_Do_List.cpp**
   - This program allows users to manage their tasks by adding, removing, and listing tasks in a to-do list format.


## Features

  **NumberGuessingGame.cpp**
    - Generates a random number for the user to guess.
    - Provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

  **SimpleCalculator.cpp**
    - Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and more.
    - Handles basic error cases like division by zero.

  **To_Do_List.cpp**
    - Add tasks to the list.
    - Remove tasks from the list.
    - View the current list of tasks. 

## Technologies Used

- C++
- Standard C++ libraries
